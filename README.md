# Data-Mining-Web-Traffic
Abstract:  We will explore a type of cyber attack, called a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS), through research of current literature, and then with a given data set, we will create models using data mining algorithms for classification of DDoS or benign web traffic. The data set has multiple features, and a classifying column with binary labels "ddos" or "Benign." The data will require preprocessing, feature selection and dimensionality reduction before model building. We will take suggestions from the literature review, and use a decision tree for feature selection of categorical variables. For dimensionality reduction of numerical data we will use PCA. After data cleaning, we separate the data into a test set and a training set. Then we used three different data mining algorithms: random forest, logistic regression and support vector machine, to build three different models with the training data set. Then we test each of the models with the test data and summarize their performance with a variety of accuracy measures and ROC curve. We use the performance summaries to compare all three models and offer a comparative analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we offer our conclusions, limitations, and a discussion on possible future work and open questions.
